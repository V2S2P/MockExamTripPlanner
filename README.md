# Understanding Helper Methods in JPA Bidirectional Relationships

This document explains **when and why to use helper methods** in JPA entity relationships, using examples from the `User`‚Äì`Role` (Many-to-Many) and `Guide`‚Äì`Trip` (One-to-Many) relationships.

---

## üß© The Core Idea

In JPA, there are **two worlds**:

1. **Java objects in memory**
2. **Database rows in tables**

When you have bidirectional relationships (where two entities reference each other), you need to keep **both sides consistent** in Java memory ‚Äî not just in the database.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example 1: User ‚Üî Role (Many-to-Many)

### Entity setup

```java
// User.java
@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
@JoinTable(
    name = "user_roles",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "user_name"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "role_name")
)
private Set<Role> roles = new HashSet<>();
```

```java
// Role.java
@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "roles")
private Set<User> users = new HashSet<>();
```

### The problem

If you do:

```java
alice.getRoles().add(admin);
```

then only the **User** knows about the relationship:

```
Alice.roles = [Admin]
Admin.users = []
```

That‚Äôs inconsistent in memory.  

### The fix ‚Äî helper method

```java
public void addRole(Role role) {
    if (role == null) return;
    roles.add(role);              // Add role to user
    role.getUsers().add(this);    // Add user to role
}
```

Now both sides agree:

```
Alice.roles = [Admin]
Admin.users = [Alice]
```

This keeps your in-memory model consistent, preventing bugs and ensuring correct persistence.

---

## üß≠ Example 2: Guide ‚Üî Trip (One-to-Many / Many-to-One)

### Entity setup

```java
// Guide.java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "guide", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<Trip> trips;
```

```java
// Trip.java
@ManyToOne
private Guide guide;
```

Here, only `Trip` is the **owning side** (it stores the foreign key).

So when you do:

```java
trip.setGuide(guide);
em.persist(trip);
```

JPA already knows how to save the relationship.  
You don‚Äôt need to update both sides.

### Optional helper (for consistency only)

```java
public void addTrip(Trip trip) {
    trips.add(trip);
    trip.setGuide(this);
}
```

This helps keep Java objects consistent in memory but isn‚Äôt required for persistence.

---

## üß† Summary

| Relationship Type | Both sides have collections? | Helper needed? | Why |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-----|
| `@ManyToMany`      | ‚úÖ Yes                      | ‚úÖ Yes (recommended) | Both sides must stay in sync in memory |
| `@OneToMany` / `@ManyToOne` | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå Not required (optional) | Only one side owns the relationship; JPA handles it |

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

- Use helper methods when **both sides have collections** (like `User` ‚Üî `Role`).
- They ensure both sides of the relationship are consistent **in memory**.
- They‚Äôre **not needed** when only one side has a list (like `Guide` ‚Üî `Trip`).

Perfect rule of thumb:
> "If both sides can hold multiple references (Many-to-Many), add helpers.
> If only one side has a list (One-to-Many), it‚Äôs optional."

# REST Assured Testing with Hamcrest

## üß© What is REST Assured?
**REST Assured** is a Java library used to test RESTful APIs. It simplifies sending HTTP requests and validating responses, making it ideal for **integration testing** in Java web applications.

In this project, REST Assured is used to verify that endpoints for `/guides`, `/trips`, and `/packing` behave correctly ‚Äî returning the right **status codes** and **JSON responses**.

Example:
```java
given()
    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + userToken)
    .when()
    .get("/trips")
    .then()
    .statusCode(200)
    .body("size()", greaterThanOrEqualTo(1));
```

This test sends a `GET /trips` request and checks that the response status is **200 OK** and that at least one trip exists.

---

## üß© What is Hamcrest?
**Hamcrest** is a library for writing **readable and flexible assertions** in Java tests. It provides matchers like `equalTo`, `greaterThan`, `hasItems`, and `notNullValue`, which make test conditions expressive and easy to understand.

Hamcrest is used inside REST Assured‚Äôs `.body()` and `.statusCode()` checks to make assertions clear and descriptive.

Example:
```java
.body("name", equalTo("Alice Johnson"))
.body("packingItems.name", hasItems("Tent", "Backpack"))
.body("packingItems[0].weightInGrams", greaterThan(0));
```

Here, Hamcrest helps express that:
- the trip name equals ‚ÄúAlice Johnson‚Äù
- the packing list includes ‚ÄúTent‚Äù and ‚ÄúBackpack‚Äù
- each packing item has a positive weight

---

## ‚úÖ Example: Mock API Testing
The test mode in this project uses a **MockPackingService** instead of the real API to ensure consistent results:

```java
@Test
void testPackingEndpoints() {
    given()
        .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + userToken)
        .when()
        .get("/trips/" + createdTripId + "/packing")
        .then()
        .statusCode(200)
        .body("packingItems.size()", equalTo(2))
        .body("packingItems.name", hasItems("Tent", "Backpack"));

    given()
        .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + userToken)
        .when()
        .get("/trips/" + createdTripId + "/packing/weight")
        .then()
        .statusCode(200)
        .body(equalTo("3300"));
}
```

This test verifies that the mock service returns two predictable items (`Tent`, `Backpack`) with a total weight of **3300 grams**.

---

## üí° Why Use Them Together?
Using **REST Assured** with **Hamcrest** allows for:
- Fluent and human-readable tests
- Reliable verification of JSON responses
- Consistent regression testing of REST APIs

Together, they ensure that your endpoints behave as expected and that future changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality.
